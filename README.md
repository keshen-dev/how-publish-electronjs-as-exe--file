# how publish electronjs as exe file
To publish an ElectronJS app as an executable file, you can follow these steps:

First, make sure you have installed the latest version of ElectronJS and all necessary dependencies for your application.

Next, you will need to package your application into an executable file. One way to do this is to use a tool called "electron-builder". You can install this tool by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install electron-builder --save-dev
```

Once electron-builder is installed, you can configure it by creating a builder section in your package.json file. Here is an example of what the builder section might look like:
```
"build": {
    "appId": "com.example.myapp",
    "productName": "My App",
    "directories": {
        "output": "dist"
    },
    "win": {
        "target": "nsis"
    }
}
```
In this example, we are configuring electron-builder to build an executable file for Windows using the "nsis" target. You can also specify other options such as the appId and productName.

Once you have configured electron-builder, you can run the following command in your terminal to package your application:

```
npm run dist
```
This command will create a directory called dist in your project directory, which will contain your packaged application.

Finally, you can distribute your application by sharing the executable file with others. In the case of Windows, the executable file will be in the dist directory and will have a name like My App Setup.exe.
